Welcome! Please read this carefully...

The "tests" folder contains subdirectories with different test
suites. Each subdirectory is for a different video, and the
programming exercises you'll do at that point.

And each subdirectory contains a file named "test_todoserver.py".
This test file contains unit tests you'll run while you are writing
code, to grade your progress. The exercise description just below the
video will tell you which directory and test file to run.

For example, for the video "3. The First Endpoint", the exercise tells
you to make the tests in "test_the_first_endpoint_1" pass. This means
you run the tests in this file:

  tests/test_the_first_endpoint_1/test_todoserver.py

The Python command to do this is:

  python3 -m unittest tests/test_the_first_endpoint_1/test_todoserver.py

And similar for the other subdirectories. Each successive version of
test_todoserver.py adds more tests. As you add to your Python
application, you advance to the next test suite.

So each video will tell you to run a set of unit tests. The only
difference will be the subdirectory under "tests". Again, it will tell
you which subdirectory to use.

At first, your program's code will be in a Python file called
"todoserver.py". That file should be in the current directory when you
run tests.

If it's not, then you will see an import error, stating
that the test cannot find the "todoserver" module.

Later, the videos will tell you to move the module into a directory
called "lib".  When that happens, you will need to set the PYTHONPATH
environment variable. The value of this variable should be the full
path to the "lib" variable.

If this value is wrong, or the variable is not set, you'll again see
an import error, stating that the test cannot find the "todoserver"
module.

How do you set environment variables? This depends on your operating
system. On MacOS, Linux, and Unix, you use the "export" command. For
example, if your code is in /Users/yourname/mycode, then you would
run:

  export PYTHONPATH=/Users/yourname/mycode/lib

Note this is the full path to the "lib" directory that contains the
"todoserver" module.
